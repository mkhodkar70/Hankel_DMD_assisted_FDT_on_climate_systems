# Hankel_DMD_assisted_FDT_on_climate_systems
The code applies the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to a dry-core general circulation model, whose basis functions for model reduction can be EOFs, DMD modes or Hankel-DMD modes (decided by the user), to predict the responses of the idealized climate system to different thermal and mechanical forcings.
